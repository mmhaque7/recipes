title: "Paella Rice "
description: This is my twist on the classic Spanish paella. Instead of
  traditional chorizo, I use Zabiha Halal Fully Cooked Spicy Italian Chicken
  Sausages for a flavorful, halal-friendly alternative. The dish features
  saffron-infused rice cooked with sausage, chicken, and seafood for a rich and
  aromatic meal. The chicken is marinated in paprika and oregano to deepen the
  flavor, while the shrimp is added at the last minute to keep it tender and
  juicy. Serve this vibrant and crowd-pleasing paella straight from the pan at
  the center of your table—perfect for sharing and enjoying together.
